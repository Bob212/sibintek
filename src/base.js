Arthur flees and is raised in a brothel, knowing very little of his birthright. Vortigern wants Arthur dead, to ensure there is no claimant to the throne.

So, in an effort to identify Arthur, Vortigern forces all the young men of Arthur\'s age to attempt to draw out the sword. Now it is Arthur\'s turn',
